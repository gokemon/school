## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) Node ^4.2.3, npm ^2.14.7
- [Bower](bower.io) (`npm install --global bower`)

### Developing

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `bower install` to install front-end dependencies.

3. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

4. Run `gulp serve` to start the development server. It should automatically open the client in your browser when ready.

## Build & development
